Scripts need to be hosted on a webserver currently.
If hosted on IIS with Insight the IIS server will need to be configured to allow download of the required file types
This can be done from MIME Type > Add > extension required and MIME Type is "application/octet-stream"


This Scripts are all currently in the testing phase and should not be used in production until indicated.
